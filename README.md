# Custsomization Interface for the Custom Dynamics 365 Events Website

As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I'm working with [Silicom Group](https://silicom.group) to help them customize the Events Portal offered by Dynamics 365's Marketing Module more easily and efficiently. The main project is available on the [D365CustomEventsWebsite repo]([url](https://github.com/julessandoz/D365CustomEventsWebsite)). In order to improve the customization experience for both Silicom employees and their customers, a customization interface is under construction on this repo. 

## Customization Interface's features

* A side menu containing the customizable settings (To Be Implemented)
* Dynamic change of the website's colors based on the changes on the settings
* Sass variables export to simplify installation in production

## Pull requests
As this is a Bachelor's thesis, external collaborations will not be accepted until at least September '23.
